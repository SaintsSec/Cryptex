## 📖 History
Cryptex started out in November, 2021, with one developer, Alex "cythes" Kollar, as an attempt to be less of a script kiddie.
It has since then became so much more. As of April, 2022, Alex decided to open the project up to the SSG community to reap some absolutely incredible results. At this point, the SSG | Cryptex Dev Team was founded with a the idea of building Cryptex into a cryptography tool that people could use, install and add to with ease. Similar to Metasploit, the project and the team has evolved so much in the little time that it has existed for.  
  
Cryptex itself has matured from Alex's hodgepodge of seventeen original but unoptimized tools, to what is now a professional-grade cryptography toolkit. Cryptex is backed by a passionate team of devs, ranging from beginners looking for a place to start, to advanced devs who want a challenge. We even have a few idea men who come up with wacky encryption ideas for us to try to implement. (Static Encryption; go check it out!) Lastly, but definitely not the least, this has been possible thanks to our sponsors who believe in the project enough to financially back us up. 
  
## 🗓️ Upcoming Release
### Cryptex V1.0.0 - Pumpkin Patch 00  

After participation in Hacktoberfest 2022, we are going to put the collective updates from the event into a new release, which we will be dubbing as the Pumpkin Patch. The plan is that for every year we participate in Hacktoberfest, we will add a new Pumpkin Patch to Cryptex.  
  
Other notes: 
- We are moving away from the Earth Invader. 
- Complete rebuild of Cryptex to work with Object-Oriented Programming. 
- It is now easier to implement new ciphers and tools.   
- Installer has been rewritten from the ground-up in Python.
- The main menu can now dynamically add ciphers and tools to the list.
- We brought back the OG 'Cryptex UI' (we made it look pretty again).
- Implemented a system that lets us use ASCII art for version names.

All of this is pushing Cryptex ever closer to its goal of becoming the `Metaploit of cryptography`
